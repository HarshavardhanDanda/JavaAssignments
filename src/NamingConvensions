Based on my observations, Class names should always start with capital letters and all the internal words should also be started with a capital letter.
Coming to functions, the first letter should be small and all the other internal words should start with a capital letter.
Variables should be short but meaningful and we must avoid giving one-character to variables.

for example if we take string builder class, it is represented as StringBuilder.
if its a function it is represented as stringBuilder.
variable can be string_builder.
